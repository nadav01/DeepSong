DeepSong is a little project which aims to raise the awareness of the progress in the capacity of artificial intelligence to the general public.<br/>
The DeepSong interface let you choose couple of singers (or bands). It collects all the singers' lyrics from all times.<br/>
Then, it traines a neural network on the corpus. The result is a new 'singer' which is a combination of all the singers/bands you chose.<br/>
After that you can start generating songs lyrics from that new artist you have created and play the 'Artificial Singers Game'.<br/>
Have fun :)
